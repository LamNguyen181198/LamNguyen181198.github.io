		<h1>A Whole Section About Me?</h1>
		<img class="small" src="../Pics/small.jpg">
		<p>Salutations visitor to my website! My name is Nguyen Tuong Lam. I am State University of New York at
			Plattsburgh
			<b>Computer Science</b> graduate student with a minor in <b>Web Design</b>.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p> At 22 years of age, I can't say that I am better than anyone. Hell,
			I don't think I am better than some of my peers. Despite the glaring problem of me being too humble to the
			point
			of underselling myself, I am a kind and caring person. I maybe quiet when
			you first talk to me but as time goes by, I will become friendlier and more energetic
			person.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>If you wish to know more about me, I have listed my Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn
			down below. I will also link my work email right.... <a class="sassy-link"

		<h1>And About My Skill Sets?</h1>
		<img class="work" src="../Pics/workjpg.jpg">
		<p>
			As for my abilities and skillsets, I do have some to offer.
			Being a Computer Science major, at the very least, I know the basic to these programming languages: <b>C++,
			HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python</b>. And with me having a minor in Web Design, that also means I have a basic
			understanding of Photoshop.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			I have also taken a course in learning how to use the game engine <b>Unity</b>. As of this point, my creation in
			Unity
			is... weird but also interesting to look at. In my opinion, it is a very solid option for
			anyone trying to learn about the world of game developement, which was the primary reason I took the course
			in the
			first place. If you have any other questions, you are free to contact me through the means I provided on the
			previous tab or you can view my resume right... <a class="sassy-link" target="_blank"
